If you are lazy and want to install/update filters easily, this tool is for you.

This is a super early and unstable version.

Roadmap:
- List multiple filters
- Handle auto updates
- Let you drag & drop .filter files

Your antivirus may detect this as a virus, shame on windows that requires a 200$+ license per year to be verified.
